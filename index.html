         <p class="list-group-item-text col-lg-7 col-md-7 col-sm-7 col-xs-12">Gusts of wind up to 80mph have caused widespread disruption, as Storm Malik sweeps across northern parts of the UK.

A woman in Aberdeen was killed by a falling tree, train routes cancelled and many homes left without power.

Forecasters have issued yellow and amber warnings for high winds across Scotland, Northern Ireland and northern England throughout Saturday.

The Tyne and Wear Metro has been temporarily closed, while gusts of 93mph were recorded in Northumberland.

Meanwhile, Northern Powergrid said engineers were working to restore power to about 36,000 customers in Northumberland and County Durham.

Police urged people in north east England and eastern Scotland to avoid travel where possible.

Scotland Railway reported "a lot of disruption" to train services early on Saturday "due to high winds and fallen trees on some routes".

A ScotRail tweet on Saturday morning said they were working with emergency services to remove the trees and restore the lines "as quickly and as safely as possible", with some cancellations in the Larbert area due to damage to overhead electric wires.

There were also reports of a trampoline blown on to the line in the Kirkcaldy area, which briefly brought the route to a standstill - although trains were able to pass through again within the hour, after the trampoline was removed.

With disruption likely to continue throughout the day, two Scottish Premiership matches - Aberdeen v St Johnstone and Dundee v St Mirren - have been postponed.

Another storm is also expected to hit Scotland and parts of Northern Ireland, as well as northern and eastern England on Sunday evening, with a yellow warning for wind in place until 12:00 GMT on Monday.

The other warnings in place are:

A yellow wind warning for Scotland, Northern Ireland and northern England from 04:00 until 15:00 on Saturday
A yellow wind warning for Orkney and Shetland from 12:00 until 20:00 on Saturday
An amber wind warning for eastern Scotland from 07:00 until 15:00 on Saturday

Named by the Danish Meteorological Institute, Storm Malik is expected to bring winds of 60mph and up to 80mph in coastal areas, on its way towards Denmark.

The Met Office said Storm Malik's impact would be greatest in Denmark on Sunday but the UK would be "dealt a glancing blow" from Saturday as it moves eastwards.

The forecaster warned injuries and danger to life could occur from flying debris, as well as from large waves and beach material being thrown onto seafronts, coastal roads and properties.

Early on Saturday, ScotRail said speed restrictions were in place on services between Inverness-Wick, Kyle of Lochalsh and Aberdeen, Dundee-Aberdeen and Fort William-Mallaig; a 40mph speed restriction is also in place on services running between Edinburgh and Linlithgow.</p>

     <h4>Storm Ana: Deadly Africa storm shows climate crisis reality - UN</h4>    
     <img src="https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/976/cpsprodpb/2188/production/_123048580_gettyimages-1238047047.jpg" class="img-responsive col-lg-5 col-md-5 col-sm-5 col-xs-12">
         <p class="list-group-item-text col-lg-7 col-md-7 col-sm-7 col-xs-12">The deadly storm that hit southern African countries this week has shown the reality of the climate crisis, a UN official has said.

The death toll from the destruction caused by Storm Ana has risen to 86.

Rescue workers are trying to reach tens of thousands who have been cut off as roads and bridges have been washed away in Madagascar, Mozambique and Malawi.

Authorities are now watching to see if a second storm - Batsirai - will hit the continent next week.

In Mozambique, where 18 people have been killed and 120,000 people affected, Maria Luisa Fornara, from the UN children's fund Unicef, described Storm Ana as a "blunt reminder" of the impact that climate change is having.

UN Secretary General Ant√≥nio Guterres said more investment was needed to "protect and save lives".

"I lost my fishing boat, it was swept away by the strong wind," Abdul Ibrahim, a fisherman in Mozambique's Nampula province told AFP news agency.

"I have never seen anything like this before. It will be difficult for me to recover."

Seeking temporary shelter in a classroom for her and her two children, Maria Jose told AFP that the first winds had blown away her house.

"I have nothing left, I lost everything."

Some of the infrastructure that had been rebuilt after Cyclone Idai in 2019 has been destroyed again.

In Madagascar, which was the first country to be hit on Monday, the death toll now stands at 48 and some 72,000 are reported to have lost their homes.

"I am very sad because we work like crazy to make money and now our house is destroyed," one woman said surveying the damage that was caused.

Malawi's President, Lazarus Chakwera, declared a state of emergency in the wake of the storm which left 20 people dead in the country.

The disaster management agency said families had been forced to carry the dead to burials because roads had been cut off.

A resident in the southern town of Chikwawa, described how fellow villagers spent two days holding on to trees as the waters swept through.

The weather authorities are keeping a close eye on Tropical Storm Batsirai which has formed in the Indian Ocean and is moving westwards.

                 <p class="p_modal">I bought this for a 10-year-old nephew who had expressed an interest in space. This book was so good I almost kept it for myself! It is full of beautiful colour plates and easy explanations. Just after he received this for his birthday, he was allowed to stay up late and watch this year's (2013) display of the Perseid meteor shower. Both the book and the meteors have stimulated his hirst for knowledge about the world about and above us. An excellent present for a child of any age.
